<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
<h2>Storing Data Stats</h2>
  <p>There’re many ways to store data, however the first module only highlights 3 of the ways, text files, spreadsheets, and databases. Text files in which you can easily store data so that a program can refer back to the file and grab all of that data, and you can also use Comma Separated Values to add more detail to your data. Spreadsheets are pretty self-explanatory since most people have used them at some point in their lives, it’s a lot easier to store data compared to the text files however you cannot use spreadsheets to store data from your programs. Databases are the most common way of storing data since the system takes care of everything and it does that by using text files, most databases utilize another language called query language in order to store data into databases.</h2>

<h2>Computing Basic Statistics.</h2>
  <p>In order to find specific information from a row or column you can use functions, such as being able to find the sum of all the data in a column or being able to find the averages of the data in a column. There are many practical reasons to use this such as finding the average score in a video game by using the Average function. </p>
<h2>Finding Patterns in Data Set</h2>
  <p>Specifically, this module teaches us how to find trends in data by using techniques like visualizing it in a graph and figuring out if the trends are up or down. Once you have all your data in a graph from you can also use regression lines to figure out whether the trends are positive or negative but most of the time it’s pretty apparent from just looking at the graph. The last thing this module teaches is correlation and how to figure it out, specifically from scatterplots since by looking at how the data is structured you can visualize a line and figure out whether the data has negative, positive, or no correlation with each other. One important thing to take away from this module is that correlation doesn’t mean causation, this means that just because the data suggests that 2 variables have a correlation it doesn’t mean that one has an impact on the other, it could just be a coincidence, for example, waking up at 6 in the morning and gas prices have a positive correlation but it probably doesn’t mean that waking up early causes gas prices to go up.
