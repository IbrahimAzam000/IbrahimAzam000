  <h2>Dairy Queen Menu Nutrition Data Set</h2>
  <p>I retrieved this data set from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/dairy-queen-menu-nutrition-data?resource=download</p>
  <p>The original data was collected from https://www.dairyqueen.com/en-us/ and was last updated on 11/30/22</p>
  <h3>Hypothesis:</h3>
  <p>1.Are the average amount of calories in Dairy Queen products lower than the average amount of calories per fast food meal?</p>
  <p>2.Is there a correlation between the amount of calories and the amount of sugar in a product?</p>
  <h3>Hypothesis 1</h3>
  <p>I determined the Average Calories in LibreOffice by using the AVERAGE(B) function which gave me an average of approximately 567</p>
  <p>I got the calories per average fast food meal from this article Healthy Fast Food - HelpGuihttps://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-eating/healthier-fast-food.htmde.org, which uses information straight from the CDC to claim that the average calories are 836.</p
  <p>So therefore, according to this the calories in an average Dairy Queen meal is less than the average calories in an average fast-food meal by 269 calories.</p>
