  <h2>Dairy Queen Menu Nutrition Data Set</h2>
  <p>I retrieved this data set from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/dairy-queen-menu-nutrition-data?resource=download</p>
  <p>The original data was collected from https://www.dairyqueen.com/en-us/ and was last updated on 11/30/22</p>
  <h3>Hypothesis:</h3>
  <p><b>1.Are the average amount of calories in Dairy Queen products lower than the average amount of calories per fast food meal?</b></p>
  <p>The reason I chose this is to figure out how much healthier Dairy Queen is than most other fast food restaurants since unlike other fast food places, DQ doesn't use a lot of ingredients high in calories such as oil, so it should in theory have lower calories.</p>
  <p><b>2.Is there a postiive correlation between the amount of sugar and the amount of fat calories in a product?</b></p>
   <p>The reason I chose this is because I would like to know whether or not the 2 variables have a correlation and if they do is it a positive, negative, or no correlation, because in doing so I can figure out how much sugar causes weight gains which is interesting to me.</p>
  
  <h3>Hypothesis 1</h3>
  <p>I determined the Average Calories in LibreOffice by using the AVERAGE(B) function which gave me an average of approximately 567</p>
  <p>I got the calories per average fast food meal from this article Healthy Fast Food - HelpGuihttps://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-eating/healthier-fast-food.htmde.org, which uses information straight from the CDC to claim that the average calories are 836.</p
  <p>So therefore, according to this the calories in an average Dairy Queen meal is less than the average calories in an average fast-food meal by 269 calories.</p>
  <p><b>I used Excel to visually graph the calories from largest to smallest</b></p>

   <br>
  <h3>Hypothesis 2</h3>
   <p>In order to determine howw much of a correlation fat calories and sugar had, I created a scatter plot in excel since the scatterplot in LibreOffice was really blocky, and by using the insert tab I was able to create a scatter plot, with Fat Calories on the Y axis and Sugar on the X axis.</p>
   <img src="https://github.com/IbrahimAzam000/IbrahimAzam000.github.io/blob/main/Sugargraph2.png?raw=true" alt="1st Graph" width="574" height="444">
   <p>According to the graph and the trend line, it is easily observable that Sugar and Fat calories have a positive correlation, which means that as the amount of sugar in a food increases then so does the fat Calories. However, have to take in account that Correlation does not mean Causation but in this case with the context behind it, it's safe to assume that one variable affects the other variable.</p>
