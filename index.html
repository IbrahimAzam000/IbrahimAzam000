  <p>There’re many ways to store data, however the first module only highlights 3 of the ways, text files, spreadsheets, and databases. Text files in which you can easily store data so that a program can refer back to the file and grab all of that data, and you can also use Comma Separated Values to add more detail to your data. Spreadsheets are pretty self-explanatory since most people have used them at some point in their lives, it’s a lot easier to store data compared to the text files however you cannot use spreadsheets to store data from your programs. Databases are the most common way of storing data since the system takes care of everything and it does that by using text files, most databases utilize another language called query language in order to store data into databases.</h2>
