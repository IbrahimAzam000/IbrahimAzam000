  <h2>Dairy Queen Menu Nutrition Data Set</h2>
  <p>I retrieved this data set from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/dairy-queen-menu-nutrition-data?resource=download</p>
  <p>The original data was collected from https://www.dairyqueen.com/en-us/ and was last updated on 11/30/22</p>
  <h3>Hypothesis:</h3>
  <p><b>1.Are the average amount of calories in Dairy Queen products lower than the average amount of calories per fast food meal?</b></p>
  <p>The reason I chose this is to figure out how much healthier Dairy Queen is than most other fast food restaurants since unlike other fast food places, DQ doesn't use a lot of ingredients high in calories such as oil, so it should in theory have lower calories.</p>
  <p><b>2.Is there a postiive correlation between the amount of sugar and the amount of fat calories in a product?</b></p>
   <p>The reason I chose this is because I would like to know whether or not the 2 variables have a correlation and if they do is it a positive, negative, or no correlation, because in doing so I can figure out how much sugar causes weight gains which is interesting to me</p>
  
  <h3>Hypothesis 1</h3>
  <p>I determined the Average Calories in LibreOffice by using the AVERAGE(B) function which gave me an average of approximately 567</p>
  <p>I got the calories per average fast food meal from this article Healthy Fast Food - HelpGuihttps://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-eating/healthier-fast-food.htmde.org, which uses information straight from the CDC to claim that the average calories are 836.</p
  <p>So therefore, according to this the calories in an average Dairy Queen meal is less than the average calories in an average fast-food meal by 269 calories.</p>
  <p><b>I used Excel to visually graph the calories from largest to smallest</b></p>
